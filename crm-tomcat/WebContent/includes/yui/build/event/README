Event - Release Notes

0.10.0

   * Added Safari dblclick to the list of legacy events.

   * When multiple identical event handlers are defined, multiple calls
     to removeListener can now remove all of them.

   * removeListener works properly for unload events

   * Legacy event bookkeeping is more efficient, improving the performance for
     adding Safari click events.

   * _unload() is more efficient, improving the page transition experience in 
     Safari in particular.

   * addListener, removeListener now return false if the function argument is
     not valid.

   * Fixed an operator precedence issue in getCharCode.

   * Added Event.getXY, which returns [Event.getPageX(e), Event.getPageY(e)]

   * Added Event.onAvailable, which will execute the callback when the element
     with the supplied id is found.  Currently searches periodically until the
     window load event or for up to 10 seconds after the onAvailable method 
     was executed.

   * The lazy listener attachment process now will poll beyond the window load
     event in order to better handle the case when a listener is defined
     late in the page but before the element is in the dom.

   * Fixed browser detection for Opera installations reporting as IE.

   * It is now possible to remove and re-add legacy events (Safari click event).
